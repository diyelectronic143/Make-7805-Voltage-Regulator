# Make-7805-Voltage-Regulator
 ## Overview
 In this project, we are going to create a step-down voltage regulator using a BC547 transistor.
 
 ## Things used in this project
 - BC547 Transistor
 - 49K Resistor
 
 ## Story
 
 In this project, we are going to create a step-down voltage regulator using a BC547 transistor and a resistor voltage divider circuit. The voltage regulator will be able to lower the voltage from a higher input voltage to a stable, lower output voltage.
 
The BC547 transistor will be used in a common emitter configuration, which means that the input voltage will be applied to the base of the transistor, and the output voltage will be taken from the collector. The resistor voltage divider circuit will be connected between the input voltage and the base of the transistor to provide a lower voltage input to the transistor.
